apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the

and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any

have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility
to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system
of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features
and it could mean that the Debt Manager app won’t work properly or at all.</span></p>

Ball will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Elias Ball cannot take
responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</span></p>

should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if
you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
permission from the bill payer for using the app.</span></p>

responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
avail the Service, Elias Ball cannot accept responsibility.</span></p>

third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to
you. Elias Ball accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</span></p>

currently available on Android – the requirements for system(and for any
additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may
change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
app. Elias Ball does not promise that it will always update the app so that it
is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have
installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app,
and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</span></p>
